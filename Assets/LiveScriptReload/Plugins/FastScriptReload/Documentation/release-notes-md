1.3 - (Experimental) - New fields added in playmode
New fields can be added and used in code
New fields can be adjusted in editor (same as standard fields)
New fields will be initialized to whatever value is specified in code or default value
Experimental feature - at this stage expect some issues
Opt-in - disabled by default to enable go to 'Window -> Fast Script Reload -> Start Screen -> New Fields -> enable'

1.2 - Debugger support
- added debugger support

1.1 - Mac support / bug fixes
**Added Mac support (only INTEL editor version, SILICON still not supported)**
Added Linux support
fixed namespace clash with Unity.Collections package
common code lib will not be included in builds
added check for auto-refresh in Editor - will proide guidance and option to adjust as otherwise full editor reload is triggered for changes
added workaround for Unity file-watcher returning wrong file path on some editor versions
added option to allow disabling DidFieldCountCheck - allowing to detour methods in those cases (eg for Mirror where it'll adjust IL and cause mismatch)
added option to configure FileWatcher paths/filters as in some cases watching root directory was causing performance issues
added minor initial-load optimisations - using session-state for items that do not need to be resolved on every reload

1.0 - First release, included features:
Fast script reload in editor / play-mode (compiles only changed files and hot-reloads them into current play session)
