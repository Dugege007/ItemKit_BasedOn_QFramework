DocKit supports writing documents as well as generating simple inherited class diagrams from code in a directory

It's very simple to use

Just right-click on any directory that has code and select @dockit /Create Class Graph to do the following

![0.ClassGraph.png](./4.DocKit.ClassGraph/Editor/0.ClassGraph.png)

After creation, it looks like this:

![1.ClassGraph.png](./4.DocKit.ClassGraph/Editor/1.ClassGraph.png)

We first look at it in Inspector below

![1.ClassGraph1_EN.png](./4.DocKit.ClassGraph/Editor/1.ClassGraph1_EN.png)

We can see the parse button, click it and the result is as follows:

![1.ClassGraph2_EN.png](./4.DocKit.ClassGraph/Editor/1.ClassGraph2_EN.png)

You can see that all the classes in the current directory are listed under the parse button.

A new window also opens as follows:

![1.ClassGraph3_EN.png](./4.DocKit.ClassGraph/Editor/1.ClassGraph3_EN.png)

So now we have our class diagram.

A class diagram is just a simple class diagram, where you can see an overview of a class and a simple inheritance relationship.

For the ClassGraph class in the figure, we can click the see button to open the code editor as follows:

![1.ClassGraph4.png](./4.DocKit.ClassGraph/Editor/1.ClassGraph4.png)

Let's write comments about the class method, as follows.

![1.ClassGraph5.png](./4.DocKit.ClassGraph/Editor/1.ClassGraph5.png)

Then we go back to the class diagram editor, right-click to reload, and see our ClassGraph class diagram look like this

![1.ClassGraph6_EN.png](./4.DocKit.ClassGraph/Editor/1.ClassGraph6_EN.png)

This way you can write some comments while reading the source code.
